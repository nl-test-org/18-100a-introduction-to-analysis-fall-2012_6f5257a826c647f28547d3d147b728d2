Textbook
--------

All readings and problem assignments are from the textbook:

Mattuck, Arthur. _Introduction to Analysis_. Pearson, 1998. ISBN: 9780130811325.

[Preface (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings/mit18_100af12_preface)

Key to the Readings
-------------------

Chapter 1.1–1.3, Appendix A means:

Read: Chapter 1, sections 1, 2, 3, and Appendix A (in the back of the book).

Key to the Assignments
----------------------

**Note**: There are three types of problems in the book; don't confuse Questions with exercises and end up doing the wrong problem!

### Questions

Q1.3/2: Question 2 in section 1.3. These occur **at the end of each section**: they are short, easy, meant to test the ideas, and have answers at the end of the chapter. Use the answers only to confirm your own, or just for a quick glance and hint.

### Exercises

1.3/2: Exercise 2 at the end of Chapter 1, tied to section 1.3. These are tied to a given section and use the techniques explained in that section; look through that section for ideas or similar examples.

### Problems

P1–3: Problem 1–3, the third problem at the end of Chapter 1. These are at the end of the chapter–anything in the chapter might be relevant to solving them.

**Notes on the table below**: The daily reading assignments (see column 3) depended on what the class had been able to cover that day, so they differed a little in order and content from the overall plan laid out in the "topics" column.
